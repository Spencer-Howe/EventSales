            <p>Hello {name},</p>

            <p>Thank you for booking a visit to Howe Ranch. Whether you're joining us for A Open Farm Day or a private tour, please review the following safety guidelines carefully:</p>

            <h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Arrival Guidelines - No Early Arrivals</h2>
            <p>
                Due to ongoing issues related to early arrivals, we are implementing stricter guidelines for all guest visits. 
                Entry is <strong>strictly prohibited before your scheduled time slot at {time_slot}.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Please <strong>do not arrive early</strong> or stage on the private road leading to the farm, as this disrupts our neighbors and compromises the safety of our staff and animals.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: #2e6c80;">Why Itâ€™s Important:</h3>
            <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Animals are being moved, and staff members are preparing for your arrival. We cannot accommodate early guests on the property, and the road is not a waiting area.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Respect for Neighbors:</strong> Our farm is located on a private road. Please refrain from idling, parking, or gathering before the start time to maintain good relations with our neighbors.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Stay On Schedule:</strong> Whether you're here for a private tour or Open Farm Day, our experiences are thoughtfully scheduled and you will not miss a thing by arriving on time or even after the scheduled start time.</li>
            </ul>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Animal Interactions & Safety</h2>
            <p>
                For your safety and the safety of our animals, <strong>please do not enter any animal pens or approach any animals until staff has reviewed safety guidelines with you and is present.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you arrive and do not see a staff member immediately, <strong>please call or text Spencer Howe at (424) 219-4212</strong> and remain in the designated waiting area. We might be assisting other guests or preparing animals for your experience.
            </p>

          <h3 style="color: #2e6c80;">Arrival Confirmation:</h3>
            <p>
                To help us ensure a safe and smooth experience for all guests, please <strong>reply to this email to confirm that you have read and understood the safety notice above.</strong>
            </p>

            <h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">What to Bring:</h2>
            <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Closed-Toed Shoes:</strong> Required for safety in animal areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Drinking Water:</strong> Stay hydrated, as we do not provide beverages on-site.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunscreen and Hats:</strong> Protect yourself from the sun while interacting with the animals.</li>
            </ul>
