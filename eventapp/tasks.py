        <p>Hi {name},</p>

        <p>This is a friendly reminder that your visit to Howe Ranch is tomorrow at {time_slot}. We are looking forward to hosting you.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Preparing for Your Visit &amp; Farm Policies</h2>
<p>
  Thank you for booking a visit to Howe Ranch — we look forward to hosting you!
  Please review the following safety guidelines and farm policies carefully, and
  confirm that you have read and shared them with your group. These experiences
  are only possible with the full support and cooperation of our guests.
</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Arrival Guidelines – No Early Arrivals</h2>
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
  <li>
    <strong>PRIVATE ROAD LAWS:</strong>
    Stopping or staging on the private farm road is prohibited. Strict <span style="color:#b30000; font-weight:bold;">15 MPH</span>
    speed limit on the monitored, unpaved street leading to Howe Ranch —
    speeding will result in <span style="color:#b30000; font-weight:bold;">loss of your pass(es)</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>EARLY ARRIVALS STRICTLY PROHIBITED:</strong>
    Guests must not arrive before the event start time. Entry is strictly
    prohibited before your scheduled time slot. Early arrivals disrupt
    operations, compromise safety while moving animals, and will not be
    accommodated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Please arrive on time or after your start time. You will not miss anything
    by arriving after your scheduled time.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>ARRIVAL:</strong>
    Turn left at the WELCOME sign, pass through the gate, and follow signage.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Animal Interactions &amp; Safety</h2>
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
  <li>
    <strong>NO DOGS:</strong>
    For the safety of our animals and guests, our farm cannot accommodate dogs.
    Most of our animals are prey species, their reactions would make the
    encounter unsafe for all, and we have trained livestock guardians to protect
    from unknown canines on site.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>SAFETY:</strong>
    Wear sunscreen, a hat, and closed-toed shoes. Important: Bring water for
    hydration.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>SUPERVISED ONLY:</strong>
    For your safety and the safety of our animals, please do not approach any
    animals until staff has reviewed safety guidelines with you and is present.
    Children must remain supervised by your group at all times.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you arrive and do not see a staff member immediately, please call or text
  Spencer Howe at <strong>(424) 219-4212</strong> and remain in the designated
  waiting area. We might be assisting other guests or preparing animals for your
  experience.
</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Transferable Only — No Refunds or Reschedules</h2>
<p>
  Experiences (open farm day passes/private experiences) are transferable, but
  not refundable, and cannot be rescheduled. As our focus is on animal care and
  our resources are perpetually at capacity, we are unable to accommodate
  changes — please do not call to request exceptions. If you transfer your
  experience, we must receive the guest’s name prior to arrival.
