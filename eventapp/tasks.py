        <p>Hello {name},</p>

        <p>Thank you for booking a visit to Howe Ranch — we look forward to hosting you! Please review the following safety guidelines and farm policies carefully, and confirm that you have read and shared them with your group. These experiences are only possible with the full support and cooperation of our guests.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Arrival Guidelines - No Early Arrivals</h2>
        <ul style="padding-left:20px;">
          <li><strong>EARLY ARRIVALS STRICTLY PROHIBITED:</strong> Guests must not arrive before the event start time. Entry is strictly prohibited before your scheduled time slot at {time_slot}. Early arrivals disrupt operations, compromise safety while moving animals, and will not be accommodated. Please arrive on time or after start time. You will not miss anything by arriving after your scheduled time.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>PRIVATE ROAD LAWS:</strong> Stopping or staging on the private farm road is prohibited. Strict 15 MPH speed limit on the monitored, unpaved street leading to Howe Ranch — speeding will result in loss of your pass(es).</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>ARRIVAL:</strong> Turn left at the WELCOME sign, pass through the gate, and follow signage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Animal Interactions &amp; Safety</h2>
        <ul style="padding-left:20px;">
          <li><strong>NO DOGS:</strong> For the safety of our animals and guests, our farm cannot accommodate dogs. Most of our animals are prey species, their reactions would make the encounter unsafe for all, and we have trained livestock guardians to protect from unknown canines on site.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>SAFETY:</strong> Wear sunscreen, a hat, and closed-toed shoes. Important: Bring water for hydration.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>SUPERVISED ONLY:</strong> For your safety and the safety of our animals, please do not approach any animals until staff has reviewed safety guidelines with you and is present.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you arrive and do not see a staff member immediately, please call or text Spencer Howe at <strong>(424) 219-4212</strong> and remain in the designated waiting area. We might be assisting other guests or preparing animals for your experience.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Transferable Only — No Refunds or Reschedules</h2>
        <p>
          Experiences (open farm day passes/private experiences) are transferable, but not refundable, and cannot be rescheduled. As our focus is on animal care and our resources are perpetually at capacity, we are unable to accommodate changes — please do not call to request exceptions. If you transfer your experience, we must receive the guest’s name prior to arrival.
        </p>
